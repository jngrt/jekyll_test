#Visualization Tutorial
##How to view your data
CommonSense should be as easy as “drag and drop”. Still, we have written a brief tutorial.

###1. Select a visualization type

In the panel on the left, you will find your phone(s), with a list of sensors below it. To view the data from each sensor, simply pick up the desired sensor, and drag it into this main window. You can also select multiple sensors at once and CommonSense will try to show them all.

CommonSense will ask you whether you want to see your data in a table, or visualize it in a line graph. You can also view a trace of your location in Google Maps.

At the moment, not all sensor data can be visualized in the way we would like it. New features and visualizations will keep on coming!

###2. Select a time range

When you choose a line chart of map visualization, you can choose a time range for which to request data. Please note that when you pick a time range where CommonSense has no data, you will get an empty view. You can try to select a bigger time range and try again.

###3. Switch between visualizations

For each new chart, table or map you add, a new tab will appear. Once the data is loaded, you can easily switch between tabs. Please note that loading data might take a moment. Consider that you are requesting an awful lot of data.

##Types of sensor data

At the moment, you can view the following (numerical) data in both a line graph and a table:
- Acceleration, in three directions: x, y and z axis; measured in Newtons
- Battery level, in percentage
- Light sensor, in Lux
- Noise, in decibels
- Orientation: pitch, roll and azimuth. You can view which way your phone is currently pointing in Google Street View
- Position, in longitude and latitude. You can now view your a trace of your position on a Google Map
- Proximity
- Signal strength

The following data can only be accessed in a simple table:
- Call state
- Data connection
- Device properties (brand, type, etc)
- Fall detection
- IP address
- Service state
- Unread messages
